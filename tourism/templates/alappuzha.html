    <h1>ALAPPUZHA</h1>
    <p>
        Alappuzha or Alleppey (Malayalam: [ɐːlɐpːuɻɐ] (listen)) is the administrative headquarters of Alappuzha district in state of Kerala, India. The Backwaters of Alappuzha are one of the most popular tourist attractions in India which attracts millions of domestic and international tourists.[3]

Alleppey is a city and a municipality in Kerala with an urban population of 174,164[4] and ranks third among the districts in literacy rate in the state. In 2016, the Centre for Science and Environment rated Alappuzha as the cleanest town in India.[5] Alappuzha is considered to be the oldest planned city in this region and the lighthouse built on the coast of the city is the first of its kind along the Laccadive Sea coast.[6]

The city is 55 km from Kochi and 155 km north of Thiruvananthapuram.[7] A town with canals, backwaters, beaches, and lagoons, Alappuzha was described by George Curzon, Viceroy of India at the start of the 20th century, as the "Venice of the East."[8] Hence, it is known as the "Venetian Capital" of Kerala.

It is an important tourist destination in India.[9] It connects Kumarakom and Cochin to the North and Kollam to the South. It is also the access point for the annual Nehru Trophy Boat Race, held on the Punnamada Lake, near Alappuzha, on the second Saturday of August every year. This is among the most popular and competitive boat races in India.[10]
